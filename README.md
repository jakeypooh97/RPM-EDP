About this Mod:

This mod integrates features from Raster Prop Monitor to enhance the docking experiance in KSP. JSI Radar and JSI External Camera are both integrated into all the stock docking ports to avoid needing extra parts. Also adds JSI Radar compatability to SSTU docking ports and all SSTU command modules with docking ports.  

JSI Radar:
requires electric charge, automatically targets docking ports in FOV, has a limited FOV of 30 Degrees and thus any docking port outside of the field of view will not be the targeted, target not saved when turned off, limited targeting range of 50km
